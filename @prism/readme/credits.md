Many of the discrete color palettes in this project are based on colormaps from [`Matplotlib`][1] and [`Scientific Coulour Maps`][2].
If you recognize your contribution, please don’t hesitate to get in touch, we’ll be happy to give you proper credit in the source code.


> ***IMPORTANT.*** *`@prism` only uses `CamelCase` names with no characters other than numbers and ASCII letters. For example, a name such as `nipy_spectral-1` is transformed into `NipySpectral1` within `@prism`.*
