`@prism` includes some original creations, but most color palettes are derived from the project below by segmenting their color maps into 10-value palettes.

  * [`Asymptote`](https:asymptote.sourceforge.io) is used, but currently offers nothing beyond [`Matplotlib`][2] (despite different implementa- tions).

  * [`Colorbrewer`](https://colorbrewer2.org).

  * [`Cubehelix`](https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable/cubehelix) is extracted from [`Palettable`][1] project.

  * [`Matplotlib`][2].

  * [`Scientific Coulour Maps`](https://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps).

  * [`Tableau`](https://www.tableau.com) is extracted from [`Palettable`][1] project.

  * [`Wes Anderson Palettes`](https://wesandersonpalettes.tumblr.com) is extracted from [`Palettable`][1] project.


> ***IMPORTANT.*** *`@prism` only uses `CamelCase` names with no characters other than numbers and ASCII letters. For example, a name such as `nipy_spectral-1` is transformed into `NipySpectral1` within `@prism`.*
