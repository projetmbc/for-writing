    (the name plays on two ideas.
    (1) A prism is where light is split into an informative
    spectrum, symbolizing how data or visuals are decomposed
    into meaningful color and style.
    (2) @prism, read as “at prism,” suggests the place where
    diffraction happens, i.e., where science meets informative
    aesthetics.)
