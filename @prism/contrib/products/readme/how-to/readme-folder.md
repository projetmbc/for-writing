### The readme folder

The `README.md` file of the contribution folder is written in small sections in the `readme` folder which has the following mandatory structure. These sections will also be used to produce documentations for the final product.

~~~
- readme
    * about.yaml
    * desc.md
    * how-to-create.md
    * how-to-use.md
    * title.md
~~~


Here is the purpose of each of these files.

  1. **`about.yaml` must not be changed.** It gives the way to gather the `MD` files to build the `README.md` file of the specific contribution folder.

  1. `title.md` is the title for the specific technology.

  1. `desc.md` is a short description of the specific technology.

  1. `how-to-create.md` gives the process to follow to create new palettes using the specific technology.

  1. `how-to-use.md` explains how to use one of the `@prism` palettes available when working with the specific technology.
