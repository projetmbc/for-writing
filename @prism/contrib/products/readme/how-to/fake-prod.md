### The fake-prod folder

This folder is a template used to create the final version of the implementation.
It must contain a palette file named as indicated in `extend.py` (the content of this mandatory file can be fake).


> ***NOTE.*** *A good practice is to provide a folder `showcase` for local testing without installation.*


> ***WARNING.*** *Make sure to leave nothing unnecessary, as the structure will be copied entirely.*
