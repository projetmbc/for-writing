Create a palette using lua

> ***CAUTION.*** *Only the folders `dev` (for creation) and `palettes` (for submission) are used for palette creation. Don't modify any other folders.*


For the moment, development requires working with `LaTeX` and the `luadraw` package: refer to the `TEX` files in the `dev/luadraw` folder.
