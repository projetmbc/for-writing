Adding new translations
=======================

What can be done?
-----------------

The `@prism` project only requires the translation of its user manual.


Where to start?
---------------

The `en` folder is the one managed by the project. It should therefore be copied to propose a new translation.


How to proceed?
---------------

The manual translation is done via directly compilable `LaTeX` files.
