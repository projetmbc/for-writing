\section{Where do the color palettes come from?}

Most color palettes are obtained from \matplotlib\ and \scicolmap\ by segmenting their color maps into $\palSize$ values.%
\footnote{
    \asymptote\ is also used, but currently offers nothing beyond \matplotlib, despite different implementations.
}
We retain only palettes that comply with the following rules.
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No repetition.}
    Some \matplotlib\ palettes are duplicated,%
    \footnote{
        Likely for historical reasons.
    }
    in which case we keep the first one in lexicographical order.
    
    \item \textbf{No reversed versions.}
    Unlike \matplotlib,%
    \footnote{
    	Most \matplotlib\ color maps have a reversed version named with the \tdoccodein{py}{_r} suffix, possibly for performance reasons.
    }
    \thisproj\ never includes reversed palettes as fixed data.
\end{itemize}


Here are the palettes that were not taken into account because they created a duplicate.

\subimport{../../../common/}{ignored-palettes.tex}


In addition to \matplotlib\ and \scicolmap\ palettes, \thisproj\ includes original creations.


\begin{tdocnote}
    Adding new palettes to \thisproj\ is straightforward. See section \ref{contrib-how-to-src-code} to get started.
