\subsection{\matplotlib}

Here are the important points to remember when using a palette similar to what \matplotlib\ offers.
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \label{reuse-std-naming}
	\thisproj\ uses a standardized notation in camel case format. Therefore, \matplotlib\ palette names such as \tdoccodein{py}{berlin} and \tdoccodein{py}{gist_heat} become \tdoccodein{text}{Berlin} and \tdoccodein{text}{GistHeat} respectively.

    \item All names ending with the suffix \verb+_r+ correspond to a reversal of the palette color order. These palettes are not integrated into the \thisproj\ project. However, the implementations provide ways to easily obtain these reversed palettes, as well as sub-palettes, and also palettes obtained by shifting the colors.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\asymptote\ and \scicolmap}

It is sufficient to apply the naming standardization explained in the previous section: see point \ref{reuse-std-naming}.
