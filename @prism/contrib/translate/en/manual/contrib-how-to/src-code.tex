Participation as a coder is made via the repository \thisrepo\ corresponding to the \thisproj\ development branch.
Here is what you can do, details can be found in the file \url{https://github.com/projetmbc/for-writing/blob/aprism/@prism/contrib/products/README.md}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create new palettes within an existing implementation. No coding skills required.
    
    \item Propose a new implementation in your favorite programming language.
    
    \item Combine both approaches.
\end{enumerate}
