\section{Where do the color palettes come from?}

Most of color palettes are obtained from \matplotlib\ and \scicolmap\ color maps by segmenting them into $15$ values.%
\footnote{
    \asymptote\ is also used, but to date, \asymptote\ offers nothing more than \matplotlib, despite different implementations.
}
We don't keep all the palettes in accordance with the following rules.
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No repetition.}
    Some \matplotlib\ palettes are repeated.%
    \footnote{
        Surely for historical reasons.
    }
    In this case, we keep the first one regarding to the lexicographical order.


    \item \textbf{No reversed version.}
    Contrary to \matplotlib,%
    \footnote{
    	Most of the \matplotlib\ color maps have a reversed version named by adding the suffix with \tdoccodein{py}{_r}.
	    Perhaps this is for performance reasons...
    }
    \thisproj\ never offers the reversed version of a palette.
\end{itemize}


In addition to the \matplotlib\ and \scicolmap\ palettes, there are some \thisproj\ contributions. If you are interested in participating, read the \verb+contrib/products/README.md+ file on the following repository.
