\section{Similar palettes}

This document includes visually similar color palettes retained by \thisproj\ to respect individual preferences, and also because there are subtle differences between them, even when minimal.


\begin{tdocimp}
    Clusters were generated semi-automatically using a program that suggests similar palettes, followed by manual curation to retain only relevant groupings.
    This approach may occasionally miss some similarities. If you identify any omissions, please contact the author of \thisproj.
