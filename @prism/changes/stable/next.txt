Palettes: `37` new palettes coming from the ''Scientific colour maps'' project.


\luadraw \prod: the ''getPal'' \func has a new optional \arg ''options'' which is a \dict like array. Here are the keys added.

    + The ''extract'' key, with a list of non-zero integers, extracts some colors from the palette without changing their order.

    + The ''reverse'' key, with a boolean value, reverses the order of the palette.

    + The ''shift'' key, with an integer value, is used to shift the colors in the palette in a circular fashion.
