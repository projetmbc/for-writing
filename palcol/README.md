The Python module palcol
========================

About palcol
------------

This project provides a collection of discrete color palettes for various programming languages,
enabling the creation and use of color maps derived from these palettes.

> ***CAUTION.*** Only discrete palettes are provided. No continuous colormaps are implemented.

Credits
-------

Many of the discrete color palettes in this project are based on colormaps from [`Asymptote`](https://asymptote.sourceforge.io/) and [`Matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/).
If you recognize your contribution, please don’t hesitate to get in touch, we’ll be happy to give you proper credit in the source code.

Supported implementations
-------------------------

The implementations are inside the folder `data`.

### JSON, the versatile default format

By default, a file `data/palettes.json` is provided to allow unsupported coding languages to easily integrate palettes.
