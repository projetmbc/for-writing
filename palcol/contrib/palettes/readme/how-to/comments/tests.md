#### TESTS section (mandatory)

You must produce a minimum number of use cases that will serve as the basis for unit tests for the accepted parsers. **Don't forget to provide functional examples and others with corrupted data!**
If it makes no sense to perform unit tests, you should still use the following code, which explicitly indicates that no tests are necessary (the absence of the section `TESTS` means that the coding of the tests were forgotten).

~~~python
# ----------- #
# -- TESTS -- #
# ----------- #

if __name__ == "__main__":
# Nothing to test!
    ...
~~~
